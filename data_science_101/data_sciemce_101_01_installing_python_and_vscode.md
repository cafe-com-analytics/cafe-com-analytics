# Data Science 101 - Part 01 - Installing python and VS Code

*This tutorial belongs to a set of tutorials intended to help other data professionals and our study group.*

**Why?**

The development of a software, the data analysis or even all the steps of a data product can be performed either in your own computer (it is said "locally developed") or using a cloud service. Nowadays (this text is being written in the end of 2023), development cloud services as [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces). In DS and ML field, [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/) and [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/) are the main players, delivering a full suite for a data team.

**But why VS Code?**


**How to use?**


```bash
code .

Just to remember, if you want to install in your user's installation:


That's it. =)
