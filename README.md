# Backlog

- [zenml](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml)
> ZenML is an extensible, open-source MLOps framework for creating portable, production-ready MLOps pipelines. Built to enable collaboration among data scientists, ML Engineers, and MLOps Developers, it has a simple, flexible syntax, is cloud- and tool-agnostic, and has interfaces/abstractions that are thoughtfully designed for ML workflows.
> 
> At its core, ZenML pipelines execute ML-specific workflows from sourcing data to splitting, preprocessing, training, all the way to serving and monitoring ML models in production. There are many built-in features to support common ML development tasks. ZenML is not here to replace the great tools that solve these individual problems. Rather, it offers an extensible framework and a standard abstraction to write and build your workflows.
